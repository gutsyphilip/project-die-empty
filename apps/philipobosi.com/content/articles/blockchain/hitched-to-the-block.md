Hey there, please ignore my poor attempt at being witty with the title. The world is changing in ways I never imagined. I've been spending my time monitoring the trends both in conversation and though quantitative analysis and reports on internet adoption and human interaction. I‚Äôm not sure how to explain this. All I can say is that I feel a strong pull towards the evolution of the internet as we know it today. The extent to which web3 and the blockchain in particular is set to revolutionize things is crazyyyyyy. 

And it's not the hype for me. I am very well aware of some major constraints that‚Äôd prevent some of these ideas from going mainstream(without further innovation) and I‚Äôll talk about that at some point. But for now, I‚Äôm doing my best to effectively navigate through all the noise and seek the meat of the action. In other words, understand the meaning and impact of things at the root level for two main reasons:


1. **First principle over everything**
    I‚Äôm a huge proponent of understanding things from first principle. If you‚Äôre not sure what that is, here‚Äôs a less technical way to describe it. It is the act of understanding things from the basics. Starting with the foundational ideas/concepts/assumptions that set the stage for every other aspect of a subject. You can learn more about it [here](https://jamesclear.com/first-principles). When learning to code roughly 5 years ago, I fell in love with understanding the basics of programming with JavaScript. I would spend several hours breaking down popular libraries and revisiting ‚Äúthe hard parts‚Äù in order to make sure I understood the bigger picture down to the details and was able to effectively separate signal from noise. That is what is actually valuable from what looks valuable.
    
2. **So much technical jargon**
    The second reason I‚Äôm taking such a plunge into working with the blockchain and web3 is the amount of technical jargon in the space. For something that is meant to transform so many lives and industries, the blockchain is still talked about in really complex ways and explained using technicalities that the average person should not need to care about. Honestly, It‚Äôs pretty new and we are all still trying to get the hang of it, so that‚Äôs bound to happen. That‚Äôs also significantly responsible for the terrible UX you may have noticed in many web 3 experiences as well as your friend‚Äôs inability to explain things to you without you dosing off(No, it‚Äôs not your fault). Going off the principle that true knowledge of something reflects in your ability to explain it simply and using relatable analogies, I‚Äôm hoping this is something I can contribute to fixing by truly understanding things at a deeper level and then sharing that journey/knowledge via various media. 


Here‚Äôs some of the things I‚Äôm particularly curious about and actively exploring in this space.

- What problem does the blockchain/web3 attempt to solve and how well does it solve it?
- What problems does it create?
- While most people are fascinated by the moon shot tokens, memecoins and what not, what other mostly ignored industries can truly benefit from this technology or a variation of it?
- As a creator, I‚Äôm particularly obssessed with the creator economy too and 
    I think my experience in building tech products puts me in a unique position to apply my learnings in solving major problems that plague the creator. As of now, I am looking to do this in the areas of building community, monetization of creative skils/work and overall governance or control of platforms built on the back of creators. We‚Äôll see what this morphs into overtime.

As usual, I‚Äôll share more learnings and thoughts around this going forward. 

Keep creating ü§çüñ§.
